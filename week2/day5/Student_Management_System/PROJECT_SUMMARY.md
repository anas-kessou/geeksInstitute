## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication
- **JWT tokens** with 24-hour expiration
- **Refresh tokens** with 30-day expiration
- **Bcrypt password hashing** with salt
- **Token storage** in localStorage
- **Automatic token refresh** on API calls

### Authorization
- **Role-based middleware** on all protected routes
- **Frontend route guards** prevent unauthorized access
- **API endpoint protection** via decorators
- **Role verification** on every request

### Best Practices
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Tokens validated on every request
- CORS properly configured
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- Input validation on backend

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables
1. **users** - User accounts (director, teacher, student)
2. **courses** - Course information
3. **enrollments** - Student-course relationships
4. **grades** - Grade records

### Relationships
- User (teacher) → Courses (one-to-many)
- User (student) → Grades (one-to-many)
- Course → Grades (one-to-many)
- Student ↔ Courses (many-to-many via enrollments)
